# Self-Hosted Honcho for Hermes Agent

Self-host [Honcho](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho) (Plastic Labs' memory layer) on your own VM instead of using their cloud. Works with [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) out of the box.

**No fork required** — just 3 config files on top of upstream Honcho.

## Background: Hermes L4 Memory

Hermes Agent has a 4-layer memory system. The cross-session memory layer is powered by [Honcho](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho), which builds a deepening model of the user across conversations — extracting observations, recalling context, and consolidating memories over time.

By default, Hermes uses Plastic Labs' managed cloud ([honcho.dev](https://honcho.dev)) + their [Neuromancer](https://blog.plasticlabs.ai/research/Introducing-Neuromancer-XR) models. This works out of the box but means your conversation data and user profile live on their servers.

### What are Neuromancer models?

[Neuromancer XR](https://blog.plasticlabs.ai/research/Introducing-Neuromancer-XR) is a specialized 8B model fine-tuned from Qwen3-8B specifically for extracting logical conclusions from conversations. Unlike general-purpose LLMs which are optimized for plausible text generation, Neuromancer is trained on ~10,000 curated social reasoning traces to follow formal logic — extracting both explicit facts ("user said they like Python") and deductive conclusions ("user is likely a developer").

It scores 86.9% on the LoCoMo memory benchmark vs. 69.6% for base Qwen3-8B and 80.0% for Claude 4 Sonnet.

**Tradeoff of not using it:** General-purpose models work well for observation extraction and memory recall — Honcho's prompts and tool-calling pipeline compensate for much of the gap. You may get slightly less precise deductive reasoning, but capable models (GLM-5, Grok 4.1) with strong function calling largely close the difference. The main advantage of self-hosting is data sovereignty, not matching Neuromancer's exact reasoning quality.

## Deployment Options

| Option | Privacy | Data location | LLM for memory | Setup | Cost |
|--------|---------|--------------|----------------|-------|------|
| **Managed cloud** (default) | Low — data + inference on 3rd party | Plastic Labs servers | Neuromancer (Plastic Labs) | None — built into Hermes | Free tier / paid |
| **Self-hosted + API** (this repo) | Medium — data on your VM, inference via API | Your VM | Any OpenAI-compatible API | ~3 minutes | API usage only |
| **Self-hosted + local model** | High — nothing leaves your network | Your VM | Local LLM (Ollama, vLLM) | More setup | Hardware only |

**Managed cloud** — Zero setup. Best for getting started. Your data is on Plastic Labs' infrastructure.

**Self-hosted + API** — This repo. Your data stays on your VM. LLM calls go to a cloud API for inference only — the provider sees request content but doesn't store your memory data. Best balance of privacy and capability.

**Self-hosted + local model** — Maximum privacy. No data leaves your network. Requires a GPU or capable CPU on your LAN running an inference server (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp). Set `LLM_VLLM_BASE_URL` to your local server. Trade-off: smaller models may produce lower quality observations and reasoning than cloud APIs.

## What this does

- Runs Honcho's full memory stack (API, Deriver, PostgreSQL, Redis) on your VM
- Routes LLM calls through any OpenAI-compatible provider (primary + backup)
- All your data stays on your VM — no third-party cloud storage
- Works with OpenRouter, Venice, Routstr, Together, Ollama, or any other provider

## Architecture

```
Hermes Agent ──► localhost:8000 (self-hosted Honcho API)
                      │
                      ├── PostgreSQL + pgvector (your VM)
                      ├── Redis cache (your VM)
                      │
                      └── Deriver/Dialectic/Dream workers
                              │
                              ├── Primary LLM provider (any OpenAI-compatible API)
                              └── Backup LLM provider (optional)
```

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04+ VM (tested on 22.04, 6GB RAM, 80GB disk)
- Docker Engine + Compose plugin
- API key from any OpenAI-compatible provider ([openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai), [venice.ai](https://venice.ai), [together.ai](https://together.ai), etc.)
- Second API key for backup (optional)

## Quick Start

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elkimek/honcho-self-hosted/main/setup.sh -o /tmp/setup.sh
bash /tmp/setup.sh
```

This installs Docker (if needed), clones Honcho, copies configs, prompts for API keys, starts everything, and configures Hermes. ~3 minutes.

## Manual Setup

### 1. Install Docker

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] \
  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $VERSION_CODENAME) stable" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Log out and back in for the group change to take effect.

### 2. Clone repos + copy configs

```bash
# Clone this config repo
git clone https://github.com/elkimek/honcho-self-hosted.git ~/honcho-self-hosted

# Clone upstream Honcho
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho.git ~/honcho

# Copy config files into the Honcho clone
cp ~/honcho-self-hosted/docker-compose.yml ~/honcho/
cp ~/honcho-self-hosted/config.toml ~/honcho/
cp ~/honcho-self-hosted/env.example ~/honcho/.env
```

### 3. Set your API keys

Edit `~/honcho/.env`:

```bash
nano ~/honcho/.env
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys:
- `LLM_VLLM_API_KEY` — primary LLM provider
- `LLM_VLLM_BASE_URL` — primary provider's API URL
- `LLM_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` — backup LLM provider (also used for embeddings)
- `LLM_OPENAI_API_KEY` — same as your primary key (needed for client init)

Any OpenAI-compatible provider works (OpenRouter, Venice, Routstr, Together, etc.) — just set the key and URL. See [Using different providers](#using-different-providers) for details.

**If you don't want a backup provider:** remove all `BACKUP_PROVIDER` and `BACKUP_MODEL` lines from `config.toml`, and set `LLM_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` to the same values as your primary (needed for embeddings). The setup script handles this automatically.

### 4. Start Honcho

```bash
cd ~/honcho
docker compose up -d
```

First run builds images and runs DB migrations (~2 minutes). Check status:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f api deriver
```

Wait ~10 seconds for the API to start, then verify:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/openapi.json | head -1
```

### 5. Configure Hermes

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.honcho
cp ~/honcho-self-hosted/honcho-config.json ~/.honcho/config.json
hermes gateway restart
```

Hermes will now use your local Honcho instead of `api.honcho.dev`.

## Model Configuration

Honcho has 4 background components that use LLM calls:

- **Deriver** — Reads every message and extracts observations about the user ("prefers Python", "privacy-focused"). Memory formation.
- **Dialectic** — Answers questions about the user on demand, with 5 reasoning levels (minimal → max). Memory recall.
- **Summary** — Compresses long sessions into short/long summaries to keep context manageable.
- **Dream** — Runs every ~8 hours. Merges redundant observations, deletes outdated ones, infers higher-level patterns. Memory consolidation.

LLM calls are tiered by task complexity. Defaults are chosen for **function-calling reliability** (the primary requirement for Honcho's tool-using agents):

| Component | Default model | Tier | When it runs |
|-----------|--------------|------|-------------|
| **Deriver** | `z-ai/glm-4.7-flash` | Light — fast, cheap, 79.5% tau-bench | Every message |
| **Summary** | `z-ai/glm-4.7-flash` | Light | Every 20/60 messages |
| **Dialectic** (low) | `z-ai/glm-4.7-flash` | Light | Per Hermes turn |
| **Dialectic** (med/high) | `x-ai/grok-4.1-fast` | Medium — built for tool use, 2M context | Complex queries |
| **Dialectic** (max) | `z-ai/glm-5` | Heavy — 89.7% tau2-bench | Hardest queries |
| **Dream** | `z-ai/glm-5` | Heavy | Every ~8 hours |

These are [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) model IDs. Any model your provider supports will work — just change the name in `config.toml`. Each component also has a backup provider that fires automatically if the primary fails on the last retry.

To change models, edit `~/honcho/config.toml` and rebuild:

```bash
cd ~/honcho
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Using different providers

Honcho supports these provider slots natively:

| Slot | Config key | How to use |
|------|-----------|------------|
| `custom` | `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` + `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` | Any OpenAI-compatible API |
| `vllm` | `VLLM_BASE_URL` + `VLLM_API_KEY` | Any OpenAI-compatible API |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI direct |
| `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic direct |
| `google` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini |
| `groq` | `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq |

You can mix providers per component in `config.toml`:

```toml
[deriver]
PROVIDER = "groq"          # fast for frequent tasks
MODEL = "llama-3.3-70b"

[dream]
PROVIDER = "anthropic"     # best reasoning for rare tasks
MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
```

## Maintenance

**Update Honcho:**

```bash
cd ~/honcho
docker compose down
git pull            # our config files are untracked by upstream, no conflicts
docker compose up -d --build
```

**View logs:**
```bash
docker compose logs -f api deriver
```

**Check queue status:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v3/workspaces/hermes/queue/status | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Backup data:**
```bash
docker compose exec database pg_dump -U honcho honcho > backup.sql
```

## Known Limitations

- **Embeddings share backup provider config** — Honcho's embedding client shares `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_*` config with the backup LLM provider. If you configure a backup, embeddings route through it too. Embedding cost is negligible.
- **One backup per component** — Honcho supports primary + one backup provider, not a full failover chain. Using a multi-provider router (e.g. OpenRouter) as primary mitigates this.
- **No E2EE** — Honcho's agents use function calling, which isn't compatible with end-to-end encryption. LLM request content is visible to the provider, but your stored data (sessions, observations, embeddings) stays on your VM.

## Files
